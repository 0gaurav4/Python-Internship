    "- <strong> Free & Open source : </strong> Available free of cost and easy to code beacause of large open source community.\n",
    "- <strong> Extensible feature / Scripting : </strong> We can write some python code in other programming languages. For example : <em>Chaquopy</em> in Android and <em>pyscript</em> in HTML.\n",

    "- <strong> Large Standard Library : </strong> Python has collection of pre-built modules and functions for various tasks.\n",
    "- <strong> Dynamically typed language : </strong> No need to specify the type  of variable, it will be taken automatically according the given value in Python.\n",
    "- <strong> Interpreted : </strong> Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, allowing for rapid development and easy debugging.\n"
